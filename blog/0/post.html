			Well, I finally got around to making a website! Now I'll have somewhere to put my thoughts, art, games and publications. This is technically the third website I've made, although the one my brother and I made when we were very young barely counts. I tried to make a proper one a while ago, but ended up deleting it and starting over.<br><br>
			While the old website used a Jekyll template, this one was done from scratch. I really feel like web development (and indeed software development in general) tends to be made way, way more complicated than it needs to be. I don't think I'll ever understand the need for stuff like Ruby when you can just use pure HTML and JavaScript. If I need to do server-side stuff (or literally anything else in the world of computers), I'm a lot more comfortable using C instead of stuff like PHP or Node.js.<br><br>
			Something I was wondering was whether or not it would be a good idea to more explicitly link the alias "Delphinoid" to my irl self like this, but after some consideration I figured that the worst-case consequences don't bother me much (plus this link already kind of exists anyway). I think that the person I present myself as under the alias "Delphinoid" is a faithful representation of me, and I think I'm okay with people who know me irl seeing that. I'd like to be the kind of person who's comfortable with showing the sort of things I might put on this website - from my amateur art to stupid philosophical ideas - to others.<br><br>
			Anyway, I guess it's a bit weird to say stuff like that!! I just wanted to address it since it has been one of the major roadblocks in making a proper website.<br><br>
