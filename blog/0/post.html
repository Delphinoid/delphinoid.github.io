			Well, I finally got around to making a website! I tried to make a proper one a while ago, but ended up deleting it and starting over.<br><br>
			While the old website used a Jekyll template, this one was done from scratch. I really feel like web development (and indeed software development in general) tends to be made way, way more complicated than it needs to be. I don't think I'll ever understand the need for stuff like Ruby when you can just use pure HTML and JavaScript. If I need to do server-side stuff (or literally anything else in the world of computers), I'm a lot more comfortable using C instead of stuff like PHP or Node.js.<br><br>
			Something I was wondering was whether or not it would be a good idea to more explicitly link the alias "Delphinoid" to my irl self like this, but after some consideration I figured that the worst-case consequences don't bother me much (plus this link already kind of exists anyway). I originally had art and other things on this website as well, but I think for now I'll leave them out.<br><br>
