			For a long time I've wanted to learn how to compose music. When I get around to making my first proper game, I'd like everything about it to be my own, from the engine to the art to the music!<br><br>
			At some point I'd like to learn to compose more experimental stuff - shoegaze (especially wintermute's stuff) and math rock are particularly inspiring for me - but for now I'm starting with some basic piano pieces. My inspiration in this direction is stuff like the OSTs for Octopath Traveler and Kingdom Hearts.<br><br>
			There's one part of the KH2 song "A Fight to the Death" that I absolutely adore: you know, the piano part roughly 32 seconds in. Earlier this week I was listening to it and wondered how it was made. It sounds so complex, yet at the same time simple enough that I thought I could understand it.<br><br>
			I started by looking at some sheet music for piano covers of the song. What I observed is that it consisted of ten "spikes" that each ascend 9 semiquavers and then descend 9 semiquavers. Overlapped with each spike is a smaller spike consisting of the same notes but one octave lower and offset by 1/4th of a beat (one semiquaver). Each spike consists of only 3 or 4 distinct notes, just played at different octaves.<br><br>
			Something I noticed is that the distinct notes these spikes consisted of looked "chord-like" somehow. I asked a friend who is much smarter than me, and he told me something exciting: these spikes are something called <i>arpeggios</i>, which are nothing but chords where the notes are played sequentially rather than all at once. Sure enough, by extracting the chord from each spike and playing them in succession, we get a really pretty chord progression that captures the "essence" of that part of the song! I found this so exciting: somehow the questions of how this part of the song was built and why it sounds so good are isomorphic to the questions of how chords and chord progressions are built and why they sound good, which are questions I'm much more comfortable with.<br><br>
			I feel really happy to have come out of this with a new piece of technology for making and understanding music. I still know nothing about music or music theory, but I'm excited to keep learning. I'm thinking of picking up a cheap keyboard at some point, since I think learning to play different songs might help with the process of gaining new compositional tools and techniques.<br><br>
			Anyway, that's mostly it for music theory today, but I'll hopefully write some more another time. On a somewhat related topic, Miku Expo is finally coming to Australia for the first time in November; I'm hoping to go!!<br><br>
