			Today I received a letter of offer of admission into a graduate research program. Technically I received it two days before the official release date, which is kind of funny. The topic is <em>Module Categories over Soergel Bimodules</em>; I'm really happy with this topic and excited to begin! Expect some posts about my adventures in pure mathematics, Ph.D. life and depression later on.<br><br>
