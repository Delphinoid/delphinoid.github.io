			Late update! My Ph.D. finally started last week. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to start until next year, since the university used up all of their Ph.D. funding in term 1, but in the end it looks like they were successful in begging the government for more money. Last month I gave a talk on module categories at the University of Sydney's tensor categories seminar, it was pretty tragic but I learned so much by doing it. As a "Disciple of Jones", I also had the opportunity to bring just a little bit of culture in the form of subfactors!<br><br>
			Since I now have an income, this month I'm moving into the city. I'm renting a cute little apartment, it's really cozy and it has its own private bathroom and everything. It even has a loft!! Unfortunately the kitchenette doesn't have a stove top and they don't allow tenants to bring in their own, but they do allow rice cookers and air fryers, so I don't need to use the shared kitchen. It'll be nice to have my own domain. It's also relatively affordable (with a strong emphasis on relatively); considering what it offers, $470 per month with bills included is a bit cheaper than many of the other places I've seen, especially since it's also less than a 5 minute walk from USYD.<br><br>
			I also finally got around to getting a skateboard.<br><br>
