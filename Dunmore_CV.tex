%\textbf{Basics of Module Categories}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Gave a two hour talk introducing categorical representation theory via the theory of module categories at the learning seminar ``Tensor Categories and their Modules'', held jointly by the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales. The seminar schedule and material are publicly available at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/tensorcategories}.\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%May 1st, 2024\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{An Introduction to Category Theory}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Organized a short and informal reading course on category theory for a small group of Honours students at the University of New South Wales, roughly walking through the first few chapters of the excellent introductory book of Emily Riehl.\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%January 2024 -- February 2024\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{UNSW Pure Mathematics Honours Presentation}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Gave a presentation based on my Honours thesis at the UNSW Pure Maths Seminar, which explained how Vaughan Jones used planar algebras in his attempt to create conformal field theories from subfactors, as well as how this led to the discovery of a new machine for generating unitary representations of groups of fractions, inspiring the forest-skein formalism.\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%November 14th, 2023\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{AMSI Vacation Research Scholarship Presentation}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Gave a brief presentation based on my AMSI Vacation Research Scholarship project at AMSIConnect, which introduced amenability within the context of discrete group $C^*$-algebras and concluded with an explanation of the Banach-Tarski paradox.\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%February 3rd, 2022\\[0.5\baselineskip]

%\cvsection{Research Experience}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{UNSW Pure Mathematics Honours Research}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Worked under the supervision of Dr.\ Arnaud Brothier to study certain kinds of ``discrete conformal field theories'' arising from subfactor planar algebras and the technology of forest-skein categories, inspired by the surprising connections of Vaughan Jones between conformal field theory, subfactor theory and Richard Thompson's groups.\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%February 2023 -- November 2023\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{AMSI Vacation Research Scholarship} \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Participated in a reading project in pure mathematics over the 2021 -- 2022 summer period, supervised by Dr.\ Arnaud Brothier and funded by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. The project was concerned with investigating the elementary theory of group $C^*$-algebras arising from discrete groups; that is, $C^*$-algebras generated by discrete topological groups, in the sense that the algebra encodes all of the information regarding the (irreducible) unitary representations of the group. Further properties of discrete groups such as amenability were then studied in the context of group $C^*$-algebras. The report is publicly available at \url{https://vrs.amsi.org.au/student-profile/daniel-dunmore/}. \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%December 2021 -- February 2022\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology Research Internship} \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Participated in a second research internship in theoretical physics, supervised by Dr.\ Andre Saraiva, as part of Scientia Professor Andrew Dzurak's group within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. Began with a very brief reading project on the basics of representation theory in the context of condensed matter physics. Investigated the implications of non-Hermitian dynamics in the context of quantum computing and devised a method for realizing effectively non-Hermitian behaviour using traditional Hermitian systems. \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%February 2021 -- June 2021\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology Research Internship} \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Participated in a 16-week research internship in computational physics, supervised by Dr.\ Andre Saraiva and Dr.\ Chris Escott, as part of Scientia Professor Andrew Dzurak's group within the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. Wrote software for automatically simulating metal-oxide-insulator silicon quantum dot nanodevices, as well analyzing the behaviour of the quantum dots. Investigated methods of modelling thermal strain in such devices and its theoretical effects on quantum dots. \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%September 2020 -- December 2020\\[0.5\baselineskip]
%\end{adjustwidth}
%\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
%\textbf{UNSW Science Talented Students Program} \\[0.5\baselineskip]
%Participated in an investigation into alternative representations of systems of multiple qubits within a team of two other students, supervised by Professor Susan Coppersmith and Dr.\ Andre Saraiva. The intent of the project was to form a method for visualizing nonlocal properties of multiple qubit systems. This involved devising a new mathematical model for such systems as well as the development of software for solving and visualizing them.\\[0.5\baselineskip]

Features implemented so far include highly optimized rigid body physics simulations with support for various colliders, joint constraints and spatial partitioning; a custom memory management system built on low-level system calls; a command pattern design structure including a programmable command-line interface; a skeletal animation system, with interpolation between multiple concurrent animations; a custom font format for GUIs, supporting BMP and MSDF (multi-channel signed distance field) rendering; a dynamic, programmable particle instancing system.
%\item Collaborated with both Thomas Dunmore and Alvin Iskender on reverse-engineering various (discontinued) multiplayer games whose source code had been lost in order to make them playable again, for the sake of video game preservation. This was done by creating custom server software and modified clients with permission from the original developer, Jacob Grahn.
