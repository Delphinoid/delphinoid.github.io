Recently, I learned about a particular researcher named Dr. Robert Lanza. Dr. Lanza is quite an interesting character indeed, as he appears to live two very separate lives: one as a well-respected medical doctor, and another as a philosopher. His pièce de résistance is his so-called theory of everything, which he dubs biocentrism: the idea that it is impossible to understand the universe in terms of physics or mathematics, and that it can only truly be understood in terms of biology. In other words, Dr. Lanza argues that we should reinterpret the physical constraints of the universe as emerging from constraints on biology.

Wait, what?

It might not be too difficult to guess the blunder Dr. Lanza has made here. Of course, the theory is based entirely on the idea that the observer effect in quantum mechanics relies on a conscious observer: possibly the most pervasive misconception in modern science. Due to its great prolificacy, I'd actually like to clear it up. I'll proceed by giving a brief lecture on basic quantum mechanics, for anyone not familiar with the observer effect.

In quantum mechanics, it is helpful to mathematically model the state of a system as a **wavefunction**: that is, a collection of all possible states that the system can be in, weighted by their probability. The concept of quantum superposition then follows from this, where we can add (superpose) these wavefunctions together to create new and completely valid states. When you measure part of a system, you typically gain more information on the allowable states that system can be in, so the wavefunction changes. When all but a single possibility remains, the wavefunction is said to have **collapsed** to a single state.

The observer effect, however, is a phenomenon that makes all of this a bit complicated. It is the idea that under certain conditions, *passively* measuring the state of a system (by ruling out possible outcomes) can actually influence the final state of that system. The classical examples of this are the double slit experiment and the much more interesting quantum eraser experiment. One way of thinking about this is that when something is in a superposition of many possible states (i.e., has the possibility of being in one of many states), it behaves as though it is in all of them at once, in the sense that we can observe interference between possible states. Note that this is not the same as the system being in multiple states simultaneously, nor is it the same as it just being in a single unknown state. To tell the truth, quantum superposition is inherently difficult to interpret because there seems to be no analogue in the macroscopic world.

Now, returning to the observer effect, you may notice that I've been very particular with my wording, and have avoided using jargon like "observer" or "observable". In quantum physics, these are actually technical terms: an **observer** refers to an apparatus capable of measuring an **observable** — some physical quantity that can be measured. There is no strict relationship between consciousness and observers, and experimental evidence does not support the idea that consciousness is necessary for a wavefunction to collapse. Believe it or not, this is still a concept that many physicists, unfortunately, fail to completely grasp. This may be due to a difficulty in separating what we want to be true from what is known to be true.

So that's all well and good, but it would seem as though the conclusion that we've reached here is that while there is no evidence to support the necessity of a conscious observer, there is no evidence against it either. The *idea that biocentrism is based on* is still technically valid in the vaguest sense, although it becomes much less cute when you start to "rigorously" define your terms, such as consciousness. In essence, the basic philosophical idea that reality emerges directly from our perception of it, which Dr. Lanza correctly recognizes as being a very old idea indeed, may well be true.

So what's the issue? The issue is that Dr. Lanza has incorrectly applied a very common misconception about quantum physics to try and give this idea some kind of scientific verification, where no possible verification exists. As a result, biocentrism is really nothing more than a restatement of a centuries old philosophical ideology, incorrectly posed as a pseudo-scientific theory with no justification offered other than "it is obviously so".

Dr. Lanza continues to state that quantum entanglement and complementarity also necessitate a biocentrism interpretation of reality. In reality, this is of course not the case: biocentrism only appears to be a convenient surface level explanation without seeking any kind of deeper understanding of the phenomena. Note that I have used the word "state" here, rather than argue. In the entire book, Dr. Lanza attempts to make no arguments in support of his idea. It is worth repeating that this is because his idea is not something that can be definitively argued for or against, and so really holds no weight in reality.

I would now like to briefly talk about a select few of the so-called "principles of biocentrism". Many of them are, in my opinion, not very well worth noting, but I will include them nonetheless.

```
First Principle of Biocentrism: What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness.
```

I would prefer to call this the Fundamental Hypothesis of Biocentrism: it effectively boils down to the idea that consciousness is strictly required for a wavefunction collapse. I'd like to give my thoughts on this, as I feel like it is an interesting discussion.

Well, as alluded to earlier, I would first find it useful to define our terms here. However, in trying to do so, we run into our first roadblock: what is consciousness?

This is really not a trivial question to answer, as consciousness is a rather vague concept in and of itself. That being said, I would personally define consciousness as the ability to not only think, but to be aware of one's own thoughts, or at least *some* of them. I see this as being more of an emergent phenomenon of the brain: the inner voice that we hear (or see, in the case of deaf people) can be thought of "fabricated" signals from our external senses. As an interesting corollary, you could then argue that consciousness requires some kind of language, which *does* have some scientific justification.

Dr. Lanza's definition of consciousness, which he tries to reveal later on in a rather arrogant paragraph, is much less decisive:

```
Instead, we can label all cognition as an amalgam of our experiential selves and whatever energy field may pervade the cosmos. To avoid such awkward phrasing, we'll allude to it by simply calling it awareness or consciousness. With this in mind (no pun intended), we'll see how any "theory of everything" must incorporate this biocentrism — or else be a train on a track to nowhere.
```

So, getting back to the topic at hand, what do we now think of this first principle? Even with our definition of consciousness, it is still rather vague. But it does not seem like a particularly sensible or revealing assumption that our perception of reality should strictly involve our consciousness. It is hypothetically possible for an entity to measure ("perceive") reality without being conscious, and I would argue that it doesn't even require any external sensors or processing unit to do this (due to an spatial exclusivity argument and the measuring of position). This is where biocentrism would (and in fact does) argue that this entity and its reality does not really exist until a *conscious* entity exists and somehow verifies what the entity is perceiving. Sure. But why?

In his book, Dr. Lanza gives an example of a rainbow, and states that "In the absence of anyone or any animal, it is easy to see that no rainbow is present". He says that "An eye–brain system (or its surrogate, a camera, whose results will only be viewed later by a conscious observer) must be present to complete the geometry". Yes, while the refracted light is still present, the qualia we call a rainbow is not. This is trivial: of course something that we define by our individual perception does not exist without us to perceive it! This does not, however, mean we can necessarily generalize the entire physical reality that we sense as not existing without perception, and we certainly can make no conclusion that it requires a conscious being. This is a totally arbitrary constraint: why does it have to be conscious? And why is every conscious observer equally capable of perceiving reality? This, in fact, leads straight into a rebuttal of the next principle.

```
Second Principle of Biocentrism: Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be separated.
```

External and internal perceptions are related only in that they are processed similarly. Reality is specifically defined to be the source of our *external* perceptions: Dr. Lanza seems to believe that internal perceptions are just as "real" as external perceptions, which is only true in a vague sense (a trend you may be noticing). Internal perceptions, such as hallucinations, are *defined* to be unreal, or imaginary, because they do not reflect our *definition* of reality. While the mode of experiencing these perceptions is the same from a very high-level, biological perspective, it is undeniably different from a physical perspective.

```
Third Principle of Biocentrism: The behavior of subatomic particles — indeed all particles and objects — is inextricably linked to the presence of an observer. Without the presence of a conscious observer, they at best exist in an undetermined state of probability waves.
```

```
Fourth Principle of Biocentrism: Without consciousness, "matter" dwells in an undetermined state of probability. Any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a probability state.
```

The third and fourth principles seem to be fairly natural corollaries of the aforementioned Fundamental Hypothesis.

```
Fifth Principle of Biocentrism: The very structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism. The universe is fine-tuned for life, which makes perfect sense as life creates the universe, not the other way around. The universe is simply the complete spatio-temporal logic of the self. 
```

This is kind of a waste of a principle, in my opinion. *Every* theory of everything thinks that the universe is explainable only through itself: this is a given. That being said, while it does technically follow that life creating the universe may require the universe to be fine-tuned for life, this doesn't represent in any way a solution to the big questions in physics and philosophy. For instance, what then creates life? The problem of the universe popping into existence out of nowhere has just been converted to a problem of life popping into existence out of nowhere.

On this topic, though, I would argue that the universe did not just "begin existing" out of nowhere. Note that what follows is just conjecture, with (as far as I know) no physical grounding. That being said, suppose we are to plot the size of the universe vs. time. I like to think of this as some graph with an increasing derivative (that is, it is increasing at an increasing rate), but with an *asymptote* at *size* = 0. So no matter how far back in time we go, I would like to think that we would never reach a point where the universe does not exist. But again, this is just conjecture, though it seems just as convincing as anything biocentrism advocates!

The seemingly fine-tuned parameters of the universe are a tougher problem to answer, but may arise from some kind of (strange and counterintuitive indeed!) axiom of the universe to increase entropy. The truth is, we don't know, but offering an explanation that defies verification or justification is just not helpful.

```
Sixth Principle of Biocentrism: Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe.
```

```
Seventh Principle of Biocentrism: Space, like time, is not an object or a thing. Space is another form of our animal understanding and does not have an independent reality. We carry space and time around with us like turtles with shells. Thus, there is no absolute self-existing matrix in which physical events occur independent of life.
```

These are probably fine in the context of what we've seen already. The latter, and the final message of biocentrism, would seem to advocate a potentially self-inconsistent reality, held together by our biological constraints. This is a fun idea to play with, but of course it is only that: a fun idea that does not really affect reality in any way.

In conclusion, I believe biocentrism is nothing more and nothing less than a philosophy that has existed for many years, with the "science" buzzword poorly slapped on like a sticker that is not waterproof. It serves only as an explanation for the plot of a science fiction novel. Funnily enough, Ueo Hisamitsu's fun light novel 紫色のクオリア (*The Qualia of Purple*) was as good an application of this concept as I can imagine, and more or less coincided with Dr. Lanza's book on biocentrism. Due to the circumstances, I'd be inclined to believe that the author was not inspired by Dr. Lanza's book, but rather by reading the misleading news articles on quantum physics that were common 10 or 15 years ago, as well as perhaps a genuine interest in philosophy and physics. For anyone interested in the philosophical aspect of biocentrism, but less so on its questionable treatment by Dr. Lanza, this novel would probably be a good substitute.
