			Some random sketches. I started the Megurine Luka one on the left last year. I wanted to do something inspired by Double Lariat for her birthday, but I found the perspective really hard to get right and abandoned it pretty quick. It also doesn't really look like Luka either. In the future I'd like to try drawing a simpler Luka to get her look down and then maybe revisit this one again.<br><br>
			Last week I also started a different sketch (on the right) to practice weird angles. It didn't end up being as exaggerated as I'd hoped, but it at least looks kinda cohesive. It's the same character I modelled in 3D ages ago: as you can see, the design has evolved a lot! Below them both is a version of the character I did a while ago that uses the older design. It's a lot more polished, maybe my drawing skills have atrophied.<br><br>
