			My name is Daniel Dunmore, I'm a student of pure mathematics broadly interested in categorical (and non-categorical) representation theory, group theory, subfactor theory and quantum field theory. I think in practice this website will mostly end up containing notes and other mathematical treatises I've written up that I have nowhere else to publish. You can find my CV <a href="./Dunmore_CV.pdf">here</a>.<br><br>
			A bit about me: my main hobbies are drawing, 3D-modelling, (2D and 3D) animation and programming. As far as programming goes, any attention I have to spare is given to <a href="https://github.com/Delphinoid/SDLOpenGLBaseC">my game engine</a>. Other interests I have are philosophy (especially metaphysics, epistemology and logic) and pretty much any form of art. Maybe later I'll put some of these personal interests back on this website.<br><br>
			To search through notes I've written, please head to the <a href="./research.html"><em>Research</em></a> tab. My personal blog and other minor pieces of writing may be found under the <a href="./blog.html"><em>Blog</em></a> tab.<br><br><br>
			<div style="text-align: center;">Thank you for reading!</div><br>
