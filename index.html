			I made this website to document random things that I care about and organize my thoughts on them.<br><br>
			A bit about me: I'm a student of pure mathematics, and am currently focusing on studying special examples of tensor categories coming from physics, as well as their 2-representation theory. My hobbies are primarily art and programming. And talking a lot.<br><br>
			Although I'm super amateur, I enjoy drawing, 3D-modelling and (2D and 3D) animation, and this kind of thing is what I expect to post most often. I also like trying new things a lot, so you might also see some attempts at writing music or prose (although I'm especially terrible at the former).<br><br>
			As far as programming goes, my attention is given almost entirely to <a href="https://github.com/Delphinoid/SDLOpenGLBaseC">my game engine</a> that I am writing from scratch in C. I have endless ideas for games that I'd eventually like to make, ranging from games that are more artistic and experimental to competitive multiplayer games.<br><br>
			I also have an interest in learning about philosophy (especially metaphysics, epistemology and logic). Even though I'm not trained at all as a philosopher, I enjoy thinking and writing about it, so I'll probably also make some dumb posts about it from time to time that will make cleverer people cringe.<br><br>
			Well, to finish off this introduction, some of my favourite results in mathematics (so far) are the Yoneda lemma, the Riesz-Fr√©chet representation theorem and the construction of Gelfand-Naimark-Segal. I think they're pretty cool, and they each have some particularly beautiful implications!<br><br>
			Oh, I almost forgot, here are my accounts on various platforms.<br><br>

			If for some strange reason you'd like to add me on Discord, Line or WeChat, well... I don't know, you can probably find a way to contact me.
